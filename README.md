# ToDo List Application

The ToDo List Application is a dynamic and feature-rich task management tool designed for mobile platforms. It allows users to create tasks, attach images, and view live updates on device information like battery level and network status. This application is built using React Native, showcasing the use of AsyncStorage for data persistence, expo-image-picker for image uploading, and react-native-maps for live location tagging.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Image Uploading:** Supports adding images to tasks from the camera or gallery.
- **Live Location Tagging:** Tasks can be tagged with the user's current location, viewable on a map.
- **Device Information Display:** Shows current battery level and network status.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks and associated data are saved locally, ensuring data persistence across sessions.
